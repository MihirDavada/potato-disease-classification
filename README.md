**Potato Disease Classification - Empowering Farmers to Detect and Prevent Crop Losses**

I have developed a CNN based solution to help potato farmers detect and prevent devastating crop diseases. The project, titled "Potato Disease Classification," leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to accurately identify two common potato diseases - Early Blight and Late Blight.

Potato farmers often suffer significant economic losses due to these diseases, but with early detection and targeted treatment, much of this loss can be avoided. My project aims to provide farmers with a reliable tool to quickly diagnose the type of disease affecting their crops, enabling them to take appropriate action and safeguard their harvests.

The technical stack for this project includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data augmentation techniques
- CNN model building and training
- Deployment of the trained model as a TensorFlow Serving (tf serving) application
- Exposure of the model through a FastAPI backend

By integrating this solution into their workflow, potato farmers can make more informed decisions, reduce waste, and maintain the health and productivity of their crops. This 
project exemplifies my commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact on the agricultural community.
